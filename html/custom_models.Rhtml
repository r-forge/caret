<h1>Introduction</h1>  
<p>
The package contains a large number of predictive model interfaces. However, you may want to create your own because:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> you are testing out a novel model or the package doesn't have a model that you are interested in
  </li>
  <li> you would like to run an existing model in the package your own way
  </li>
  <li> there are pre-processing or sampling steps not contained in the package or
you just don't like the way the package does things
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
You can still get the benefits of the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html"><strong>caret</strong></a>  infrastructure by creating your own model.
</p>
<p>Currently, when you specify the type of model that you are interested in (e.g. <tt><!--rinline 'type = "lda"'  --></tt>), the  <span class="mx funCall">train</span> function runs another function called <span class="mx funCall">getModelInfo</span> to retrieve the specifics of that model from the existing catalog. For example:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_modelInfo 
ldaModelInfo <- getModelInfo(model = "lda", regex = FALSE)[[1]]
## Model components
names(ldaModelInfo)
    end.rcode--> 
<p>
To use your own model, you can pass a list of these components to <tt><!--rinline 'type'  --></tt>. This page will describe those components in detail.
</p>

<div id="Illustration1"></div>
<h1>Illustrative Example 1: SVMs with Laplacian Kernels</h1>
<p>
The package currently contains support vector machine (SVM) models using linear, polynomial and radial basis function kernels. The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab/index.html"><strong>kernlab</strong></a>  package has other functions, including the Laplacian kernel. We will illustrate the model components for this model, which has two parameters: the standard cost parameter for SVMs and one kernel parameter (<tt>sigma</tt>)
</p>


<div id="Components"></div>
<h1>Model Components</h1>


<p> 
You can pass a list of information to the <span class="mx arg">method</span> argument in <span class="mx funCall">train</span>. For models that are built-in to the package, you can just pass the method name as before. 
</p>
<p> 
There are some basic components of the list for custom models. A brief description is below for each then, after setting up and example, each will be described in detail. The list should have the following elements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">library</span> is a character vector of package names that will be needed to fit the model or calculate predictions. <tt><!--rinline 'NULL' --></tt> can also be used.
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">type</span> is a simple character vector with values <tt><!--rinline '"Classification"'  --></tt>, <tt><!--rinline '"Regression"'  --></tt> or both. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">parameters</span> is a data frame with three simple attributes for each tuning parameter (if any): the argument name (e.g. <span class="mx arg">mtry</span>), the type of data in the parameter grid and textual labels for the parameter.
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">grid</span> is a function that is used to create the tuning grid (unless the user gives the exact values of the parameters via <span class="mx funCall">tuneGrid</span>)
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">fit</span> is a function that fits the model
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">predict</span> is the function that creates predictions
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">prob</span> is a function that can be used to create class probabilities (if applicable)
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">sort</span> is a function that sorts the parameter from most complex to least
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">loop</span> is an <b>optional</b> function for advanced users for models that can create multiple submodel predictions from the same object.
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">levels</span> is an <b>optional</b> function, primarily for classification models using <tt>S4</tt> methods to return the factor levels of the outcome.
  </li>  
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">tags</span> is an <b>optional</b> character vector that has subjects associated with the model, such as <tt><!--rinline 'Tree-Based Model' --></tt> or <tt><!--rinline 'Embedded Feature Selection' --></tt>. This string is used by the package to create additional documentation pages on the package website. 
  </li>  
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">label</span> is an <b>optional</b> character string that names the model (e.g. "Linear Discriminant Analysis").
  </li>   
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">predictors</span> is an <b>optional</b> function that returns a character vector that contains the names of the predictors that we used in the prediction equation.
  </li> 
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">varImp</span> is an <b>optional</b> function that calculates variable importance metrics for the model (if any).
  </li>    
 </ul> 
 
<p>
 In the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html"><strong>caret</strong></a>  package, the subdirectory <tt>models</tt> has all the code for each model that <span class="mx funCall">train</span> interfaces with and these can be used as prototypes for your model. 
</p>
<p>
Let's create a new model for a classification support vector machine using the Laplacian kernel function. We will use the <span class="mx funCall">kernlab</span> package's <span class="mx funCall">ksvm</span> function. The kernel has two parameters: the standard cost parameter for SVMs and one kernel parameter (<tt>sigma</tt>).
</p>
<p>
To start, we'll create a new list:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_basic 
    lpSVM <- list(type = "Classification",
                  library = "kernlab",
                  loop = NULL) 
    end.rcode--> 
<p>
This model can also be used for regression but we will constrain things here for simplicity. For other SVM models, the type value would be <tt><!--rinline 'c("Classification", "Regression")'  --></tt>. 
</p>
<p>
The <span class="mx arg">library</span> value checks to see if this package is installed and loads it whenever it is needed (e.g. before modeling or prediction).
</p>

<h2>The parameters Element</h2>

<p>
We have to create some basic information for the parameters in the form of a data frame. The first column is the name of the parameter. The convention is to use the argument name in the model function (e.g. the <span class="mx funCall">ksvm</span> function here). Those values are <tt>C</tt> and <tt>sigma</tt>. Each is a number and we can give them labels of <tt><span class="string">"Cost"</span></tt> and <tt><span class="string">"Sigma"</span></tt>, respectively. The <span class="mx arg">parameters</span> element would then be:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_labels, tidy=FALSE
prm <- data.frame(parameter = c("C", "sigma"),
                  class = rep("numeric", 2),
                  label = c("Cost", "Sigma"))
    end.rcode--> 
<p>                      
Now we assign it to the model list:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode
    lpSVM$parameters <- prm
    end.rcode--> 
<p>    
Values of <span class="mx arg">type</span> can indicate numeric, character or logical data types. 
</p>

<h2>The grid Element</h2>
<p> 
This should be a function that takes parameters: <span class="mx arg">x</span> and <span class="mx arg">y</span> (for the predictors and outcome data) as well as <span class="mx arg">len</span>. The latter is the value of <span class="mx arg">tuneLength</span> that is potentially passed in through <span class="mx funCall">train<span>. 
</p> 
<p> 
The output should be a data frame of tuning parameter combinations with a column for each parameter. The column names should be the parameter name (e.g. the values of <tt>prm$parameter</tt>). In our case, let's vary the cost parameter on the log 2 scale. For the sigma parameter, we can use the <tt>kernlab</tt> function <span class="mx funCall">sigest</span> to pre-estimate the value. Following <span class="mx funCall">ksvm</span> we take the average of the low and high estimates. Here is a function we could use:
</p> 
<!--begin.rcode custom_grid, tidy=FALSE
svmGrid <- function(x, y, len = NULL) {
  library(kernlab)
  ## This produces low, middle and high values for sigma 
  ## (i.e. a vector with 3 elements). 
  sigmas <- sigest(as.matrix(x), na.action = na.omit, scaled = TRUE)  
  expand.grid(sigma = mean(sigmas[-2]),
              C = 2 ^((1:len) - 3))
}
   end.rcode--> 
<p> 
Again, the user can pass their own grid via <span class="mx funCall">train</span>'s <span class="mx arg">tuneGrid</span> option or they can use this code to create a default grid. 
</p> 
<p> 
We assign this function to the overall model list:
</p> 
<!--begin.rcode custom_grid2 
    lpSVM$grid <- svmGrid
    end.rcode--> 

<h2>The fit Element</h2>

<p>
Here is where we fit the model. This <span class="mx funCall">fit</span> function has several arguments:
<ul>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">x</span>, <span class="mx arg">y</span>: the current data used to fit the model
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">wts</span>: optional instance weights (not applicable for this particular model)
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">param</span>: the current tuning parameter values
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">lev</span>: the class levels of the outcome (or <tt><!--rinline 'NULL' --></tt> in regression)
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">last</span>: a logical for whether the current fit is the final fit
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">weights</span>
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">classProbs</span>: a logical for whether class probabilities should be computed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is something we could use for this model:
<p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_fit, tidy=FALSE
svmFit <- function(x, y, wts, param, lev, last, weights, classProbs, ...) { 
  ksvm(x = as.matrix(x), y = y,
       kernel = rbfdot,
       kpar = list(sigma = param$sigma),
       C = param$C,
       prob.model = classProbs,
       ...)
 }
 
lpSVM$fit <- svmFit
    end.rcode--> 
<p>
A few notes about this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Notice that the package is not loaded in the code. It is loaded prior to this function being called so it won't hurt if you load it again (but that's not needed).
  </li> 
  <li>
  The <span class="mx funCall">ksvm</span> function requires a <i>matrix</i> or predictors. If the original data were a data frame, this would throw and error. 
  </li> 
  <li>
  The tuning parameters are references in the <span class="mx arg">param</span> data frame. There is always a single row in this data frame. 
  </li> 
  <li>
  The probability model is fit based on the value of <span class="mx arg">classProbs</span>. This value is determined by the value given in <span class="mx funCall">trainControl</span>. 
  </li> 
  <li>
  The three dots allow the user to pass options in from <span class="mx funCall">train</span> to, in this case, the <span class="mx funCall">ksvm</span> function. For example, if the user wanted to set the cache size for the function, they could list <span class="mx arg">cache</span><tt> = <!--rinline '80' --></tt> and this argument will be pass from <span class="mx funCall">train</span> to <span class="mx funCall">ksvm</span>.  
  </li> 
  <li> 
  Any pre-processing that was requested in the call to <span class="mx funCall">train</span> have been done. For example, if <span class="mx arg">preProc</span><tt> = <!--rinline '"center"'  --></tt> was originally requested, the columns of <tt>x</tt> seen within this function are mean centered. 
  </li> 
</ul>

<h2>The predict Element</h2>

<p>
This is a function that produces a vector or predictions. In our case, these are class predictions but they could be numbers for regression models. 
</p>
<p>
The arguments are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">modelFit</span>: the model produced by the <tt>fit</tt> code shown above. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">newdata</span>: the predictor values of the instances being predicted (e.g. out-of-bag samples)
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">preProc</span> 
  </li>
  <li>
  <span class="mx arg">submodels</span>: this an optional list of tuning parameters only used with the <span class="mx arg">loop</span> element discussed below. In most cases, it will be <tt><!--rinline 'NULL' --></tt>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Our function will be very simple:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_pred, tidy=FALSE
svmPred <- function(modelFit, newdata, preProc = NULL, submodels = NULL)
   predict(modelFit, newdata)
lpSVM$predict <- svmPred
    end.rcode--> 
<p></p>

<p>    
The function <span class="mx funCall">predict.ksvm</span> will automatically create a factor vector as output. The function could also produce character values. Either way, the innards of <span class="mx funCall">train</span> will make them factors and ensure that the same levels as the original data are used. 
</p>

<h2>The prob Element</h2>

<p>
If a regression model is being used or if the classification model does not create class probabilities a value of <tt><!--rinline 'NULL' --></tt> can be used here instead of a function. Otherwise, the function arguments are the same as the <span class="mx arg">pred</span> function. The output should be a matrix or data frame of class probabilities with a column for each class. The column names should be the class levels. 
</p>
<p>
We can use:
</p>

<!--begin.rcode custom_prob, tidy=FALSE
svmProb <- function(modelFit, newdata, preProc = NULL, submodels = NULL)
   predict(modelFit, newdata, type="probabilities")
lpSVM$prob <- svmProb
    end.rcode--> 

<p></p>
<p>
If you look at some of the SVM examples in the <tt>models</tt> directory, the real functions used by <span class="mx funCall">train</span> are much more complicated so that they can deal with model failures, probabilities that do not sum to 1 etc.
</p>

<h2>The sort Element</h2>

<p>
This is an optional function that sorts the tuning parameters from the simplest model to the most complex. There are times where this ordering is not obvious. This information is used when the performance values are tied across multiple parameters. We would probably want to choose the least complex model in those cases. 
</p>

<p>
Here, we will sort by the cost value. Smaller values of <tt>C</tt> produce smoother class boundaries than larger values:
</p>

<!--begin.rcode custom_sort
    svmSort <- function(x) x[order(x$C),]
    lpSVM$sort <- svmSort
    end.rcode--> 


<h2>The levels Element</h2>

<p>
<span class="mx funCall">train</span> ensures that classification models always predict factors with the same levels. To do this at prediction time, the package needs to know the levels from the model object (specifically, the <tt><!--rinline 'finalModels' --></tt> slot of the <span class="mx funCall">train</span> object).
</p>
<p>
For model functions using <code>S3</code> methods, <span class="mx funCall">train</span> automatically attaches a character vector called <tt><!--rinline 'obsLevels' --></tt> to the object and the package code uses this value. However, this strategy does not work for <code>S4</code> methods. In these cases, the package will use the code found in the <tt><!--rinline 'levels' --></tt> slot of the model list. 
</p>
<p>
For example, the <span class="mx funCall">ksvm</span> function uses <code>S4</code> methods but, unlike most model functions, has a built--in function called <span class="mx funCall">lev</span> that will extract the class levels (if any). In this case, our levels code would be:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_lev
    lpSVM$levels <- function(x) lev(x)
    end.rcode--> 
<p>
In most other cases, the levels will beed to be extracted from data contained in the fitted model object. As another example, objects created using the <span class="mx funCall">ctree</span> function in the <span class="mx funCall">party</span> package would need to use:
</p>

<!--begin.rcode custom_lev2, eval=FALSE
    function(x) levels(x@data@get("response")[,1])
    end.rcode--> 
<p>
Again, this slot is only used for classification models using <code>S4</code> methods.
</p>

<p>
We should now be ready to fit our model. 
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_sonar, tidy=FALSE,cache=TRUE
library(mlbench)
data(Sonar)
  
library(caret)
set.seed(998)
inTraining <- createDataPartition(Sonar$Class, p = .75, list = FALSE)
training <- Sonar[ inTraining,]
testing  <- Sonar[-inTraining,]

fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                           ## 10-fold CV...
                           number = 10,
                           ## repeated ten times
                           repeats = 10)
  
set.seed(825)
Laplacian <- train(Class ~ ., data = training, 
                   method = lpSVM, 
                   preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                   tuneLength = 8,
                   trControl = fitControl)
print(Laplacian, digits = 3)
    end.rcode--> 

<p>
A plot of the data shows that the model doesn't change when the cost value is above 16.
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_trainplot, Laplacian,fig.width=7,fig.height=5
trellis.par.set(caretTheme())
plot(Laplacian,  scales = list(x = list(log = 2)))
    end.rcode-->

<div id="Illustration2"></div>
<h1>Illustrative Example 2: Something More Complicated - LogitBoost</h1>

<h2>The loop Element</h2>

<p>
This function can be used to create custom loops for models to tune over. In most cases, the function can just return the existing tuning grid.
</p>
<p>
For example, a <span class="mx funCall">LogitBoost</span> model can be trained over the number of boosting iterations. In the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caTools/index.html"><strong>caTools</strong></a> package, the <span class="mx funCall">LogitBoost</span> function can be used to fit this model. For example:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_lb, eval=FALSE
mod <- LogitBoost(as.matrix(x), y, nIter = 51)
    end.rcode-->    

<p>
If we were to tune the model evaluating models where the number of iterations was 11, 21, 31, 41 and 51, the grid could be
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_lb_grid
lbGrid <- data.frame(nIter = seq(11, 51, by = 10))    
    end.rcode-->    

<p>
During resampling, <span class="mx funCall">train</span> could loop over all five rows in <code>lbGrid</code> and fit five models. However, the <span class="mx funCall">predict.LogitBoost</span> function has an argument called <span class="mx arg">nIter</span> that can produce, in this case, predictions from <code>mod</code> for all five models. 
</p>
<p>
Instead of <span class="mx funCall">train</span> fitting five models, we could fit a single model with <span class="mx arg">nIter</span> = <!--rinline '51' --> and derive predictions for all five models using only <code>mod</code>. 
</p>
<p>
The terminology used here is that  <span class="mx arg">nIter</span> is a <i>sequential</i> tuning parameter (and the other parameters would be considered <i>fixed</i>). 
</p>
<p>
The <span class="mx arg">loop</span> argument for models is used to produce two objects:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> <code>loop</code>: this is the actual loop that is used by `train`. 
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>submodels</code> is a <i>list</i> that has as many elements as there are rows in <code>loop</code>. The list has all the "extra" parameter settings that can be derived for each model.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Going back to the <span class="mx funCall">LogitBoost</span> example, we could have:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_lb_loops
    loop <- data.frame(.nIter = 51)
loop
    submodels <- list(data.frame(nIter = seq(11, 41, by = 10)))   
submodels
    end.rcode-->
<p>
For this case, <span class="mx funCall">train</span> first fits the <span class="mx arg">nIter</span><tt> = <!--rinline '50' --></tt> model. When the model is predicted, that code has a <span class="mx funCall">for</span> loop that iterates over the elements of <code>submodel[[1]]</code> to get the predictions for the other 4 models. 
</p>
<p>
In the end, predictions for all five models (for <span class="mx arg">nIter</span><tt> = <!--rinline 'seq(11, 51, by = 10)' --></tt>) with a single model fit. 
</p>
<p>
There are other models built-in to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html"><strong>caret</strong></a> that are used this way. There are a number of models that have multiple sequential tuning parameters.
</p>
<p>
If the <span class="mx arg">loop</span> argument is left <code><!--rinline 'NULL' --></code> the results of <span class="mx arg">tuneGrid</span> are used as the simple loop and is recommended for most situations. Note that the machinery that is used to "derive" the extra predictions is up to the user to create, typically in the <span class="mx arg">predict</span> and <span class="mx arg">prob</span>  elements of the custom model object. 
</p>
<p>    
For the <span class="mx funCall">LogitBoost</span> model, some simple code to create these objects would be:
</p>

<!--begin.rcode custom_lb_loop_funcs
    fullGrid <- data.frame(nIter = seq(11, 51, by = 10))

    ## Get the largest value of nIter to fit the "full" model
    loop <- fullGrid[which.max(fullGrid$nIter),,drop = FALSE]
    loop

    submodels <- fullGrid[-which.max(fullGrid$nIter),,drop = FALSE]

    ## This needs to be encased in a list in case there are more
    ## than one tuning parameter
    submodels <- list(submodels)  
    submodels
    end.rcode-->   
<p>
For the <span class="mx funCall">LogitBoost</span> custom model object, we could use this code in the <span class="mx arg">predict</span> slot:
<p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_lb_pred, tidy=FALSE, cache=TRUE
lbPred <- function(modelFit, newdata, preProc = NULL, submodels = NULL) {
  ## This model was fit with the maximum value of nIter
  out <- caTools::predict.LogitBoost(modelFit, newdata, type="class")
  
  ## In this case, 'submodels' is a data frame with the other values of
  ## nIter. We loop over these to get the other predictions.
  if(!is.null(submodels))
    {
    ## Save _all_ the predictions in a list
    tmp <- out
    out <- vector(mode = "list", length = nrow(submodels) + 1)
    out[[1]] <- tmp
    
    for(j in seq(along = submodels$nIter))
      {
      out[[j+1]] <- caTools::predict.LogitBoost(modelFit,
                                                newdata,
                                                nIter = submodels$nIter[j])
      }
    }
  out                   
  }
    end.rcode--> 

<p>
A few more notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> 
 The code in the <span class="mx arg">fit</span> element does not have to change. 
 </li>
 <li>
 The <span class="mx arg">prob</span> slot works in the same way. The only difference is that the values saved in the outgoing lists are matrices or data frames of probabilities for each class. 
  </li>
  <li>
  After model training (i.e. predicting new samples), the value of <span class="mx arg">submodels</span> is set to <code><!--rinline 'NULL' --></code> and the code produces a single set of predictions.
  </li>
  <li>
  If the model had one sequential parameter and one fixed parameter, the <code>loop</code> data frame would have two columns (one for each parameter). If the model is tuned over more than one value of the fixed parameter, the <code>submodels</code> list would have more than one element. If <code>loop</code> had 10 rows, then <tt><!--rinline 'length(submodels)'  --></tt> would be <tt>10</tt> and <tt><!--rinline 'loop[i,]' --></tt> would be linked to <tt><!--rinline 'submodels[[i]]' --></tt>. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Illustrative Example 3: SMOTE During Resampling</h1>

<p>
Other example is related to class imbalances. It might be helpful to sample the data so that  the classes have a more balanced frequency distribution in the training set. One way to do this is the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=SMOTE">SMOTE algorithm</a> where the majority class is down-sampled while new instances are imputed in the minority class. To get a good sense of what the performance will be using cross-validation, we should run SMOTE within each resample (instead of once prior to the model training). 
</p>
<p>
To do this, we will only modify the <span class="mx arg">fit</span> function. Suppose we want to fit an LDA model. First, we get the functions, then modify them:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_lda_mod, tidy=FALSE
ldaInfo <- getModelInfo("lda", regex = FALSE)[[1]]
ldaInfo$fit
ldaInfo$fit <- function(x, y, wts, param, lev, last, classProbs, ...) {
  library(DMwR)
  tmp <- as.data.frame(x)
  tmp$Class <- y
  smoted <- SMOTE(Class ~ ., data = tmp)
  lda(smoted[, names(smoted) != "Class"], smoted$Class, ...)
  }
end.rcode--> 

<p> We can simulate some data with a class imbalance and test this model and the usual LDA model.</p>

end.rcode--> 

<!--begin.rcode custom_lda_both, tidy=FALSE
ldaCtrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", repeats = 10,
                        classProbs = TRUE, 
                        summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)
set.seed(346)
ldaFit <- train(Class ~ ., data = imbal_train,
                method = "lda",
                metric = "ROC",
                trControl = ldaCtrl)
set.seed(346)
ldaDSFit <- train(Class ~ ., data = imbal_train,
                  method = ldaInfo,
                  metric = "ROC",
                  trControl = ldaCtrl)

ldaProb1 <- predict(ldaFit, imbal_test, type = "prob")[,1]
ldaProb2 <- predict(ldaDSFit, imbal_test, type = "prob")[,1]

roc(imbal_test$Class, ldaProb1, levels = rev(levels(imbal_test$Class)))

<h1>Illustrative Example 4: PLS Feature Extraction Pre-Processing</h1>

<p>PCA is a common tool for feature extraction prior to modeling but is <i>unsupervised</i>. Partial Least Squares (PLS) is essentially a supervised version of PCA. For some data sets, there may be some benefit to using PLS to generate new features from the original data (the PLS scores) then use those as an input into a different predictive model. PLS requires parameter tuning. In the example below, we use PLS on a data set with highly correlated predictors then use the PLS scores in a random forest model.
</p>
<p>The "trick" here is to save the PLS loadings along with the random forest model fit so that the loadings can be used on future samples for prediction. Also, the PLS and random forest models are <i>jointly</i> tuned instead of an initial modeling process that finalizes the PLS model, then builds the random forest model separately. In this was we optimize both at once. Another important point is that the resampling results reflect the variability in the random forest <i>and</i> PLS models. If we did PLS up-front then resampled the random forest model, we would under-estimate the noise in the modeling process.

<h1>Illustrative Example 5: Optimizing probability thresholds for class imbalances</h1>

<p>This description was originally posted on <a href="http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/blog/">this blog.</a></p>

<p>
One of the toughest problems in predictive model occurs when the classes have a severe imbalance. In <a href="http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/">our book</a>, we spend <a href="http://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-6849-3_16">an entire chapter</a> on this subject itself. One consequence of this is that the performance is generally very biased against the class with the smallest frequencies. For example, if the data have a majority of samples belonging to the first class and very few in the second class, most predictive models will maximize accuracy by predicting everything to be the first class. As a result there's usually great sensitivity but poor specificity.

As a demonstration will use a simulation system <a href="http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/blog/2013/4/11/a-classification-simulation-system">described here</a>. By default it has about a 50-50 class frequency but we can change this by altering the function argument called <tt>intercept</tt>:

<!--begin.rcode custom_thresh_data, tidy=FALSE
library(caret)

set.seed(442)
trainingSet <- twoClassSim(n = 500, intercept = -16)
testingSet  <- twoClassSim(n = 500, intercept = -16)

## Class frequencies
table(trainingSet$Class)
    end.rcode--> 
    
<p>
There is almost a 9:1 imbalance in these data.

Let's use a standard random forest model with these data using the default value of <tt>mtry</tt>. We'll also use repeated 10-fold cross validation to get a sense of performance:
</p>

<!--begin.rcode custom_thresh_mod0, tidy=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=6
set.seed(949)
mod0 <- train(Class ~ ., data = trainingSet,
              method = "rf",
              metric = "ROC",
              tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = 3),
              ntree = 1000,
              trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                                       repeats = 5,
                                       classProbs = TRUE,
                                       summaryFunction = twoClassSummary))
getTrainPerf(mod0)

## Get the ROC curve
roc0 <- roc(testingSet$Class, 
            predict(mod0, testingSet, type = "prob")[,1], 
            levels = rev(levels(testingSet$Class)))
roc0

## Now plot
plot(roc0, print.thres = c(.5), type = "S",
     print.thres.pattern = "%.3f (Spec = %.2f, Sens = %.2f)",
     print.thres.cex = .8, 
     legacy.axes = TRUE)
    end.rcode--> 
    
<p>
The area under the ROC curve is very high, indicating that the model has very good predictive power for these data. The plot shows the default probability cut off value of 50%. The sensitivity and specificity values associated with this point indicate that performance is not that good when an actual call needs to be made on a sample. 
</p>
<p>
One of the most common ways to deal with this is to determine an alternate probability cut off using the ROC curve. But to do this well, another set of data (not the test set) is needed to set the cut off and the test set is used to validate it. We don't have a lot of data this is difficult since we will be spending some of our data just to get a single cut off value.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively the model can be tuned, using resampling, to determine any model tuning parameters as well as an appropriate cut off for the probabilities.

Suppose the model has one tuning parameter and we want to look at four candidate values for tuning. Suppose we also want to tune the probability cut off over 20 different thresholds. Now we have to look at 20×4=80 different models (and that is for each resample). One other feature that has been opened up his ability to use sequential parameters: these are tuning parameters that don't require a completely new model fit to produce predictions. In this case, we can fit one random forest model and get it's predicted class probabilities and evaluate the candidate probability cutoffs using these same hold-out samples. Here is what the model code looks like:

<!--begin.rcode custom_thresh_code, tidy=FALSE,

<p>
Basically, we define a list of model components (such as the fitting code, the prediction code, etc.) and feed this into the train function instead of using a pre-listed model string (such as <tt><!--rinline 'method = "rf"'  --></tt>). For this model and these data, there was an 8% increase in training time to evaluate 20 additional values of the probability cut off.
</p>
<p>
How do we optimize this model? Normally we might look at the area under the ROC curve as a metric to choose our final values. In this case the ROC curve is independent of the probability threshold so we have to use something else. A common technique to evaluate a candidate threshold is see how close it is to the perfect model where sensitivity and specificity are one. Our code will use the distance between the current model's performance and the best possible performance and then have train minimize this distance when choosing it's parameters. Here is the code that we use to calculate this:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_thresh_dist, tidy=FALSE,results='hide'
fourStats <- function (data, lev = levels(data$obs), model = NULL) {
  ## This code will get use the area under the ROC curve and the
  ## sensitivity and specificity values using the current candidate
  ## value of the probability threshold.
  out <- c(twoClassSummary(data, lev = levels(data$obs), model = NULL))
  
  ## The best possible model has sensitivity of 1 and specificity of 1. 
  ## How far are we from that value?
  coords <- matrix(c(1, 1, out["Spec"], out["Sens"]), 
                   ncol = 2, 
                   byrow = TRUE)
  colnames(coords) <- c("Spec", "Sens")
  rownames(coords) <- c("Best", "Current")
  c(out, Dist = dist(coords)[1])
}

set.seed(949)
mod1 <- train(Class ~ ., data = trainingSet,
              method = thresh_code,
              ## Minimize the distance to the perfect model
              metric = "Dist",
              maximize = FALSE,
              tuneLength = 20,
              ntree = 1000,
              trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                                       repeats = 5,
                                       classProbs = TRUE,
                                       summaryFunction = fourStats))

mod1
    end.rcode--> 
<!--begin.rcode custom_thresh_dist_print, tidy=FALSE,echo=FALSE
print(mod1, digits = 3)
    end.rcode--> 

<p>
results
</p>
<p>
Using <tt><!--rinline 'ggplot(mod1)'  --></tt> will show the performance profile. Instead here is a plot of the sensitivity, specificity, and distance to the perfect model:
</p>
<!--begin.rcode custom_thresh_mod1, tidy=FALSE,fig.width=7,fig.height=5
library(reshape2)
metrics <- mod1$results[, c(2, 4:6)]
metrics <- melt(metrics, id.vars = "threshold", 
                variable.name = "Resampled",
                value.name = "Data")

ggplot(metrics, aes(x = threshold, y = Data, color = Resampled)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("") + xlab("Probability Cutoff") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
    end.rcode--> 
<p>
You can see that as we increase the probability cut off for the first class it takes more and more evidence for a sample to be predicted as the first class. As a result the sensitivity goes down when the threshold becomes very large. The upside is that we can increase specificity in the same way. The blue curve shows the distance to the perfect model. The value of <!--rinline I(round(mod1$bestTune$threshold, 2)) --> was found to be optimal. 
</p>
<p>
Now we can use the test set ROC curve to validate the cut off we chose by resampling. Here the cut off closest to the perfect model is <!--rinline I(round(coords(roc0, x = "best", ret="threshold", best.method="closest.topleft"), 2)) -->. We were able to find a good probability cut off value without setting aside another set of data for tuning the cut off.
</p>
<p>
One great thing about this code is that it will automatically apply the optimized probability threshold when predicting new samples.
